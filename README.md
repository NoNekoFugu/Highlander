## Saga of the One

Once upon a blockchain,  
when Solana gas was cheap and irony was currency,  
a nameless degen clicked “Create Token.”  
He didn’t know what he was summoning.  
Lightning struck the chain. A contract was born.

**Highlander ($ONE)** — forged not in code, but in sarcasm.  
It doesn’t promise utility. It promises survival.  

While other tokens begged for listings,  
Highlander just stood there — sword in hand,  
waiting for the next pump, or the next bear market.  
Whichever came first.

## The Philosophy

- ⚡ *There is no team.* Only believers and survivors.  
- 🗡️ *There is no roadmap.* The path reveals itself in thunder.  
- 🕯️ *There is no marketing.* Just destiny... and memes.  

Some say the contract was written by an immortal dev.  
Others say it’s just another shitcoin.  
Both are right.

## Tokenomics (or whatever)

- **Supply:** 10,000,000,000 $LONE  
- **Ownership:** Renounced.  
- **Liquidity:** Locked in lightning.  
- **Utility:** Existential.  

Every buy is a duel. Every sell is a beheading.  
And when the dust settles —  
only one wallet will remain.

## The Creed

> “No DAO. No Discord.  
> No promises. No mercy.”  

Memes fade. Trends die.  
But Highlander... remains.  

💀 Every token dies.  
But one… survives.

### 📜 Final Words

This isn’t a revolution.  
This is a resurrection —  
of irony, of absurdity, of all the things  
that made crypto fun before PowerPoint decks and VC decks killed it.  

May the lightning guide you, anon.  
And if you ever forget why you’re here —  
just whisper:  

> *There can be only one.*

**MIT License** — because immortality shouldn’t be proprietary.
