## ⚡ Mission

We are not a project.  
We are an ancient clan of traders — born between the bear market and the bull run.

Every hundred years, a new token appears —  
a new immortal with a roadmap, a whitepaper, and new promises.

They come... and they fall.  
Some vanish in the first round,  
others survive long enough to reach a CEX listing.  
But in the end of this crypto battle —  
**only one will remain.**

---

## 🗡️ Our Principles

- Don’t promise immortality — just outlive the rest.  
- Every pump is a *Quickening.*  
- Every dump is a lesson.  
- Market cap fades, irony endures.

## 💀 Our Philosophy

We don’t seek investors —  
**we summon the Clan.**

The Clan of those who remember PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB.  
Who saw the death of 4meme gods and the fall of pump.fun prophets.  
Who know that memes live not for utility — but for legend.

We don’t sell tokens.  
**We pass the sword.**

## ⚔️ Roadmap — “The Game of Immortals”

1. **Awakening (Launch)** — the token emerges from the fog of blockchain, without a marketing plan or hope.  
2. **The First Duel (First Pump)** — liquidity tests the will, the chart trembles, the sword glows.  
3. **The Quickening** — the fusion of irony, despair, and 20x leverage.  
4. **Judgment Day (Regulation)** — the SEC notices movement on the chart.  
5. **The Last One** — only the one who holds till the end shall remain.

## 🕯️ The Clan’s Code

> “We lived in the age of liquidity and forgotten legends.  
> We traded until we became memes ourselves.  
>  
> And if fate allows it,  
> we shall raise the sword once more,  
> to protect what no longer makes sense.”

## 📜 Eternal Disclaimer

HIGHLANDER is not a financial instrument.  
It is a **crypto saga** — a tribute to absurdity, irony, and survival.  
No team. No presale. No mercy.  
Only lightning — and the blockchain remembers.
