> “There can be only one.”

A meme token born from **lightning**, **irony**, and **pure survival instinct**.  
In a world of millions of coins, only one can stand.  

No promises. No roadmap.  
Just instinct, memes — and immortality.  

💀 Every token dies.  
But one… survives.

### ⚡ Token Philosophy

Highlander isn’t a project — it’s a survival experiment.  
Every meme wants to live forever, but only one will.  
We don’t build utilities. We build legends.  

---

### 🧠 Core Principles

- 🗡️ **Irony is utility** — if you get it, you get it.  
- ⚡ **Survival > hype** — fads fade, the meme remains.  
- 💬 **Decentralized mythology** — the story writes itself.

### 🌩️ Lore

Forged in lightning.  
Born in irony.  
Trained by chaos.  
And when the storm comes…  
There can be only one.
